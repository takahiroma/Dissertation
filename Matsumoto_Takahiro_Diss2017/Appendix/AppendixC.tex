\section{Robustness Check}
\hspace{0.5cm} 

The following tables show the regression result of the elasticities of demand for yellow cabs with respect to own price and wait time, replacing the number of medallions (N=8,000) in Section 4 by 7,000 or 9,000 and checked robustness. Compared to the results presented in Table \ref{tab:lnfare_regression}, the main results below hold the same.

Next, the tables below show the regression result of the elasticities of demand for yellow cabs with respect to Uber's trips and wait time, replacing the number of medallions (N=9,000) in Section 5 by 8,000 or 10,000 and checked robustness. Compared to the results presented in Table \ref{tab:lnuber_regression}, the main results below hold the same.
